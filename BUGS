This following list contains those bugs which I'm aware of.  Please
make sure that bugs you report are not listed here.  If you can fix one
of these bugs/limitations I'll certainly be glad to receive a patch.

Severity: [  *] to [***]


[ **]  For GNU libc on Linux, there is still no solution for the UTMP
       problem.
       [Among others: PR libc/39]

[ **]  There are problems with signal handling when using LinuxThreads.

[ **]  The `cbrtl' function is inaccurate.  The algorithm used for `double'
       and `float' is not usable for `long double'.

[ **]  Not really a bug, but it could lead to such:
       The RPC code is ugly ugly ugly.  It's more or less verbatim taken
       from Sun's code and therefore mostly lacks complete prototypes and
       (more important) the use of `const'.  It *definitely* needs to be
       cleaned.

[  *]  The precision of the `sinhl' and/or `asinhl' function do not seem
       to be the best.

[  *]  The syslog function should print to the console if the LOG_CONS
       flag was given.
       [PR libc/72]

[  *]  On Linux, the <linux/posix_types.h> is not clean enough to satisfy
       the C++ namespace rules.  Declaring `struct fd_set' also makes
       `fd_set' available in the global namespace which conflicts with
       the definition of `fd_set' in glibc.
       [PR libc/79]

[  *]  On Linux, there should be a way to prevent defining the symbol
       NGROUPS_MAX in the <linux/limits.h> header file.  In glibc it
       is defined in <posix1_lim.h> which must not make the other
       symbols in <linux/limits.h> available.
       [PR libc/140]
